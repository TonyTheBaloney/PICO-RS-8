# CHIP-RS-8 Emulator

A CHIP-8 Emulator written in Rust. This project aims to learn rust programming while creating a CHIP-8 emulator, 
learning about Rust and Rust GUI libraries with sound, understanding the CHIP-8 architecture, and using Tokio threads.

## Features
- Full CHIP-8 instruction set support
- Swappable font sets in GUI

## TODO
- Implement sound support
- Add automated tests for instruction set
- Improve GUI
- Add drag-and-drop support for loading ROMs
- Add support for more CHIP-8 variants (CHIP-48, Super CHIP-8)
- Add correct speed control for emulation
- Add GUI for easier programming and debugging (Like bgb's memory viewer and register viewer)
